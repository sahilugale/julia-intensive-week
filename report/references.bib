abstract = {The dynamics of Airy beams modeled by the fractional Schr\"{o}dinger equation (FSE) with the potential barrier are numerically investigated. Adjusting the L\'{e}vy index provides a convenient way to control the diffraction of Airy beams which presents the non-diffraction and splitting property. It has been found that the total reflection of beams occurs when the depth of the single potential barrier exceeds the threshold, and that the number of reflected waves is influenced by the L\'{e}vy index and the location of potential barrier. However, the periodic self-imaging phenomenon of Airy beams is shown under a symmetric potential barrier when the L\'{e}vy index is equal to one, and the self-imaging period of the asymmetric Airy beams is analytically demonstrated and is as twice as that of symmetric Gaussian beams, moreover, the chaoticon of light field is formed during propagation as the L\'{e}vy index increases. All the properties of Airy beams modeled by FSE confirm the potential application in optical manipulation.},
